# SmartRockets
Note: Made with C++ 14 and the Raylib 3D Library.
<br>
Simple AI genetic algorithm for several rockets to reach the enemy spaceship.
After each round or generation, rockets pass on and crossover dna from the mating pool
that is created based on the distance and collision of the enemy spaceship for each rocket. 
In addition, each rocket must avoid the planet in the middle of the screen. Each rocket must
reach the enemy spaceship within a certain time limit.
